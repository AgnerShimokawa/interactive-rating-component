## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

With this challenge I've learned to get information from the DOM, getting a value from a specific value from a tag, and adding a text to a specific tag.

### Continued development

While doing this challenge I got stuck trying to figure it out how to get the value the user chose and display it on the console, only to realize that I was complicating things and it was much simpler to get to the solution. So for future project I'll try to not overthink and try to pre-solve the whole before trying to get to te specifics of it.
